## Introduction

PyCaret is an open-source, low-code machine learning library in Python that automates the end-to-end machine learning process. It allows you to quickly compare multiple models, perform hyperparameter tuning, and evaluate model performance with minimal code.

In this tutorial, we cover:
- How to set up PyCaret for classification and regression tasks.
- How to compare multiple models and select the best one.
- How to make predictions using the best model.

## Installation

To install PyCaret, run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
pip install pycaret
```

## Usage

### Classification Example
In the classification example, we use the **Glass Dataset** to predict the type of glass based on its properties. PyCaret automatically handles data preprocessing, model selection, and evaluation.

### Regression Example
In the regression example, we use the **Diamond Dataset** to predict the price of diamonds based on their features. PyCaret simplifies the process of comparing regression models and selecting the best one.

## Metrics Explanation

### Classification Metrics
- **Accuracy**: The percentage of correctly classified instances.
- **AUC**: Area Under the Curve, measures the model's ability to distinguish between classes.
- **Recall**: The percentage of actual positives correctly identified.
- **Precision**: The percentage of predicted positives that are actual positives.
- **F1 Score**: The harmonic mean of precision and recall.
- **Kappa**: Measures agreement between predicted and actual classes.
- **MCC**: Matthews Correlation Coefficient, a balanced measure for binary classification.

### Regression Metrics
- **MAE**: Mean Absolute Error, the average of absolute differences between predicted and actual values.
- **MSE**: Mean Squared Error, the average of squared differences between predicted and actual values.
- **RMSE**: Root Mean Squared Error, the square root of MSE.
- **R2**: R-squared, the percentage of variance in the dependent variable explained by the independent variables.
